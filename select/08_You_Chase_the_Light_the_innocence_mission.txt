You get out of my head now, honey
You get out of my head
You and your colors
You and your painting
I can forget you probably

You stay out of my way now, honey
You just stay out of my way
This is my Grace Coast
This is my homeland
You're always coming and going (but I always come back)

Let's talk about your freedom (I am drawn to this place, as I'm drawn to you)
Let's talk about my lack of it (as I'm drawn to you, as I'm drawn to you)
Let's talk about my feelings (a moth to the light)
Let's talk about your lack of them (to the light, to the light)
And you preach such beauty
You missed the point

You go down with your friends every day
You go down to the sea
Light on the water
For the light on the water
I work the whole day
You chase the light

Look out there
Can't you see what I see, what I see, what I see?

Go paint the ladies on the beach (they mean nothing to me)
With crinolines and parasols (they are part of the scenery)
(I don't know why you go on this way)
To shade their beautiful faces
From the sunlight that you love so well (I love you more, I love you more)
Isn't that funny? (No, I don't think that's funny)
I think it's funny

So, you get out of my head now, won't you?
Just stay out of my head
Move down the coastline
Move to a new town

And don't say you love me
What does that mean?
I don't want to keep you bottled in my glass
You are a free moth
Go chase the light and leave me so
