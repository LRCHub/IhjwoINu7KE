That's all i want to say before
I'll start to be so fucking bored
Cause i can't deal to keep myself
Far away from my own consciousness
That's just a little tip for you
So please don't show me gratitude
It's just about to go ahead
And throw out the shit from your wasted head

You're driving me crazy crazy

Standing out and chasing your own way
Try to find the path of a new day
Don't be out from this
But keep it rolling till your life is changing!

Look, what i tried to say, i know
Sounds like an easy way to go.
And i will never understand
Why don't you keep staying on your track
Solutions live inside of you
There's nothing i can ever do
To help you getting over that
Pulling out your mind form this crazy trap

You're driving me crazy crazy

Standing out and chasing your own way
Try to find the path of a new day
Don't be out from this
But keep it rolling till your life is changing!

Standing out and chasing your own dreams
Try to find the path of a new breeze
Don't be out from this
But keep it rolling till your life is changing!
