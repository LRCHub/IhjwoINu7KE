I'm searching for something that won't change
As pure as the midnight snow on the Jasper rangesInto the everlasting night,
I'll chase the light

Got to keep on moving, gotta take the chance
Cause I'm losing my rhythm with every step of the danceVERSE:
Further and further, until there's strange land
I can't let my shadow determine where I'll standBRIDGE:
And when it shines, it's gonna shine (shine) like a million suns
Rises ignite the fire, glow, coming sweet as golden goods
As thick as thieves, we shall receive, burning bright sin from the king
Shine your light and save my soul

I wish I was with you, holding you tight
Cause my angels get sullied by the demons of the night, Repeat first verse, End on
